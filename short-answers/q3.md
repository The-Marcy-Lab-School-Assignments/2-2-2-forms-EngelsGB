# Question

Take these 4 html buttons:

```html
<button></button>
<button type="submit"></button>
<button type="reset"></button>
<button type="button"></button>
```

What is the default behavior of each button when clicked?

# Answer

`<button></button>` and `<button type="submit"></button>`
The default behavior of these two is to send the data from the local browser to the server and redirect to a new website.

`<button type="reset"></button>`
The default behavior of a reset type button is to reset all the values in the form to their default values.

`<button type="button"></button>`
The button type button has no default behavior and does nothing when clicked.

Great response, it's important to note that a button with no type is a submit button within a form but just a regular button outside a form.
