# Question

Why do you need labels for every input? What are the two ways to associate a label with an input?

# Answer

We need labels to put a name on each input that can be read out loud by a screen reader for non-seeing users. We can associate labels to inputs by adding the `for` attribute on the label tag or nesting the input tag inside the label tag.
